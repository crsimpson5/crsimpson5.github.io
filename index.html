    <p>In high school I took some coding classes and they ended up being my most enjoyed classes by far. The best
      part of coding for me is working through a logical problem and then having my program work as I want it to. I
      am currently working towards a career in web developement.
    </p><br>
    <p>I'm the youngest in my family and am 9+ years younger than my sister and brother. I have a playful, loving cat
      named Ava that always wants my attention.
    </p><br>
    <p>My favorite hobbies are gaming and esports. I play competitive team-based games, and enjoy watching the
      Overwatch League and other esports tournaments. My favorite sport is soccer and I'm a Sporting KC fan. I like
      things that go fast like cars and rockets. I love science and learning about how things work.
